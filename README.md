**Multivariable Newton-Raphson Method - Python Script**

Python script for the Multivariable Newton-Raphson method that displays each step of the algorithm's execution.

**Overview**

This Python script demonstrates the Multivariable Newton-Raphson method for finding roots of multivariable functions. The script not only calculates the roots but also provides a detailed printout of each step in the algorithm's execution.

**Features**

    Implements the Multivariable Newton-Raphson method.
    Displays each step of the algorithm, including intermediate calculations.
    Allows users to input their own multivariable function and initial guess.
    Allows the user to change the precision of the solutions.

Example how to use is written in the script.
